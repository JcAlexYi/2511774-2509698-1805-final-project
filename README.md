OVERVIEW OF PROJECT
This is a 2D monster-killing game, we call it "beat the starfish". Players can kill monsters to upgrade themselves. The story takes place under the sea, and the main color behind is blue.

INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION
Because there are only two people in our team, we have a good distribution of workload. The theme of fighting monsters is the most suitable for both of us among many ideas. Juncheng and Romel each did research on the current 2D monster fighting games and then summarized and change idea. Juncheng proposed to make a game with an ocean background theme, and Romel agreed. During the programming period, since it involved many areas that we were not good at, Juncheng and Romel chose to divide the entire game into different parts to split the programming, and each person chose the part they were good at. The biggest challenge we faced was the jet lag between China and the UK, which made it impossible for us to communicate the progress in time. Sometimes when there was a problem with the code, we could not communicate in time, but we overcame it well, We decided not to change each other's code at will, we would leave a message to each other and modify it together.

THEMES
Our theme is the ocean, and the main character is the starfish, because the starfish is a five-pointed star, which represents that in real life we ​​will also face many doubts and temptations. We use the starfish to represent these things that affect us.

DESIGN
In this game, we include action, attack, rebirth, upgrade system, the game has a complete structure

AESTHETIC DIMENSIONS
We don't have high requirements for the aesthetics of this game. We hope that the color tone of the game is comfortable and will not give people a bad impression. On the technical level, we want to show the technology we have mastered, make a fun game and make it feel like a game.

UNREALISED ASPECTS OF PROJECT
If we have more time and more people, this game will be better. We will have a great improvement in aesthetics, the background will not be boring, we will add more scenes, and there will be many more characters. Each character will have skills and more ways to attack. The monsters' health will be thicker, and the game difficulty will increase.
